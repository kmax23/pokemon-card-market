            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                Poké Stocks is where Pokémon cards become the stock market of nostalgia — we track them like shares,
                analyze their growth, and help you make informed bets in the collectible card market.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="about-content">
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                We believe Pokémon cards are more than just playthings — they’re alternative assets that have
                consistently outperformed traditional markets. Our goal is to bring data, transparency, and tools
                so fans, collectors, and investors can navigate this world with confidence.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                We launched in 2024 after seeing the same stories: people discovering that rare cards from childhood
                were now worth exponentially more. Data shows that since 2004, Pokémon cards have delivered
                ~3,800% growth, drastically outpacing benchmarks like the S&P 500. We built this site to be
                the reliable source for daily price tracking, historical trends, and insights that feel more like
                a stock platform than a hobby site.
            </p>

            <h2>The Team</h2>
            <p>
                We’re collectors turned analysts — people who spent hours trading cards and now spend hours crunching
                numbers. We understand rarity, condition, sealed status, and market psychology. And yes — we also
                love pulling cards from booster packs.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Poké Stocks?</h2>
            <p>
                Unlike generic price trackers, we treat Pokémon like a financial asset: daily prices, weekly averages,
                sealed product valuations, historical trends. If you want the price of that 1st edition Charizard
                or sealed box, or want to compare your portfolio to the stock market — Poké Stocks bridges that gap.
